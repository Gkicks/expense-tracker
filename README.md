# Design

## Colour Scheme

I used the colorama library to style the font by colour. I chose to only change the font colour as I believe this makes the application look cleaner and more professional.
I chose the following colours for different commands:
    
- Red: to display error messages

- Blue: welcoming messages for the user

- Green: for valid inputs

![green-message](assets/images/green-message.png)

- Yellow: to display pandas dataframes

![yellow-message](assets/images/yellow-message.png)

- Magenta: to display the message when the transaction is being added and the user selects to quit

## Flowcharts

- The flowcharts were created using Miro
