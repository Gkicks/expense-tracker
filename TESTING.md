## PEP8 Validator

I ran my code throught the [Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). This showed no errors:

## Manual Testing

### Testing User Stories

### Client Goals

**Goal**|**How is this Achieved?**
:-----:|:-----:
A simple program that users will want to use|The program is intuitive and guides the user through each step of using it. It is a simple program and the colours used, for the fonts, provide interest to the user
An program that meets the userâ€™s needs|The program allows the user to input transactions, to be able to analyse their spending and to view their transactions
The user to feel their security is taken seriously|When an existing user enters their password the text is shown as asterisks so it is hidden from anyone that could be watching. The passwords are stored, in Google Sheets, as encrypted to prevent hacking. The error message, for the username and password not matching, doesn't say whether it's the username or password that has been entered wrong. This is another level of security to stop another user working out these details from which is wrong

### First Time Visitor Goals

**Goal**|**How is this Achieved?**
:-----:|:-----:
To be able to set up a new account|The user selects N or n, from the page at the beginning of the programe, and then follows the steps to create their account
To understand how to use the program|The program guides the user, though every step of the way, and is simple and intuative to use
To be able to choose their own username|The user is able to choose their own username as long as it's not already in use by another user

### Returning Visitor Goals

**Goal**|**How is this Achieved?**
:-----:|:-----:
For personal data to be stored securely|Bcrypt has been used so that users passwords are encrypted before they're stored in Google Sheets
To access an exisiting account|The first menu asks the user if they are a new or existing user. The user enters E or e to access an existing account
To be able to add transactions, by category and with a description|These are all asked for when the user choses to add a tranasaction
To be able to view the sum and mean values of their transactions, by category, for a selected date range|The user is able to do both these things by selecting option 2 from the main menu
An option to view their transactions for a selected date range|The user is able to view their transactions from a selected 90 day period
A pleasant user experience|This is a simple and visually plesant program to use

## Future Testing

For anyone wishing to test this program, as an existing user, I have left some data saved in Google Sheets

![Image of Percy Pig's Spending](assets/images/percy-spending.png)

Percy's username is percypig and his password is Passw0rd!

## Bugs

### Resolved Bugs

**Bug**|**Resolution**
:-----:|:-----:
Date entered could be in the future|Added code to get todayâ€™s date and check whether this values was greater than the date entered
Was getting a keyError when an existing user was entering their password|Moved the username\_password\_dic to the part of the function just before the if statement relating to this, rather than at the beginning of the function
Error that line length was too long for the code to add the data to the Google sheet|"This was because it was indented several times. Added a separate function
The enter transaction function was asking the user to pick an option between 1 and 6 rather than asking if they would like to perform another option|There was only a break for one of if statements in the while loop. Added breaks for all if statements in the function
The second loop of entering a transaction resulted in enter Y / N without asking the user if they would like to perform another action|Moved the get\_transaction function from the main function to the choose\_options function
The user was able to enter a negative transaction amount|Add a check, to the validate\_amount function, to check that the amount entered is greater than 0
User was being asked for the date, after picking the option to quit, from the main menu functions|Removed transaction functions from the main function
The previous method I had to validate the transaction amount was to two decimal places (if len(float\_number.rsplit('.')[-1]) != 2) was not working for intergers the had two numbers but was for integers of a different length. I decided that it would be a better user experience if all integers could be entered|Used a regex expression to validate
Was able to create a username that was all lower case to one that exited (ie, Barry and barry but, Google Sheets considers these the same name and so could not create a new sheet|"Added .lower() to the username input to stop this being case sensitive
After fixing the previous bug, the f statements showing the users username were displaying in lowercase|Removed .lower() from the input and created a new variable named username.lower. This is the variable used to record the name, and create a new workbook, in google sheets
The username input was allowing more than one word to be chosen for the username|I considered allowing this to stay in place but, following research around the best practise for usernames, I decided it would be better for this to only contain one word, for simplicity. I added an if statement to check for â€œ â€œ in the username validation
The user was able to enter the date in the format D/M/YYYY rather than the format asked (DD/MM/YYYY)|Added a check that split the date at the / character and then checked the length of each part
The user entering an integer or DD/MM wasnâ€™t returning a error|Added a check to make sure the date inputted is 10 characters long
Out of bounds nanosecond timestamp error due to a date entered before 21/09/1677|I added a check to make sure the date entered was this century
The user entering more than one word in the transaction description was generating an error|Changed the validation, from checking isalpha() to using a regex pattern that looks for only words and spaces
When validating a date range the error statement was in an infinite loop. This is because there was a nested while loop where the start\_date and end\_date were being validated, in their own loops and the validate date range was the final nested loop. The get\_date\_range loop was going back to the validate date\_range each time there was a valueerror and this was causing an infinite loop|I separated the getting the start and end date into their own function. 
When a blank input was given in the main menu option, the error message was appearing but the program terminated|The blank entry validation wasnâ€™t in the try statement. It was added to the try statement

### Unresolved Bugs

- When the pivot table is returned, from the analyse spending function, the headers on the tables displayed aren't inline (the amount header shows slightly higher). A future implementation could be to improve the visual showing of the pivot table

![image of pivot table headers](assets/images/pivot-headers.png)

- The user can still type whilst the command messages are printing which causes an error message in the next input. This would be another consideration for a future implementation
